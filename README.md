Do you play any water puzzle game and despair because you don't
find a solution? Give **TubeSort** and its algorithm a try!

What is TubeSort?
-----------------

**TubeSort** is a puzzle game and Java library with tools to
bruteforce possible solutions. It comes with highly optimized
solving algorithms to avoid high CPU loads.

**TubeSort** comes with no UI to play the game manually.
However, the API can be used to perform valid steps manually.

**TubeSort** is built with plain Java components and relies on
**no other dependencies** at runtime.

Installation
------------
**TubeSort** requires at least **Java 16** to run. It uses its
new records feature to create simple, human-readable and
immutable classes which are optimal to keep thread safety.

Usage
-----
Use ```java TubeSort [<level>[:<moves>],...]``` to bruteforce
as many levels as you want. Currently, three different types of
levels are available: "easy", "hard" and "random". You can also
specify the maximum number of steps the algorithm should take to
solve the game.

It will then display all possible and shortest moves.

Contributing
------------
**TubeSort** is an Open Source project. Feel free to add new
features to this project and help others to play or bruteforce
solutions for their water puzzle games.

Donation
--------
**TubeSort** is initially developed by a single person: me. :D
It took hours to create not just a water puzzle game but also a
highly optimized algorithm to solve any game whenever possible.
I also added a lot of tests to keep the project in good quality.
